## ⚠️ Not medical advice

Every post in this repository is **n=1 personal health tracking** by Trisha Black, published as part of the [EndEndo.io](https://endendo.io) ecosystem. Nothing here is a recommendation that you do the same protocol, take the same supplement, or expect the same result. Your body is not mine, your baseline is not mine, and — particularly relevant for readers with endometriosis or adenomyosis — **your disease severity, medication regimen, and comorbidities make generalization from a single case inappropriate**.

Before changing your diet, starting a supplement, or undertaking any detox/cleanse protocol, talk to a licensed practitioner who knows your history. For people with endometriosis specifically, this means an OBGYN, reproductive endocrinologist, or a functional medicine practitioner familiar with the condition — not a wellness influencer, and not a protocol you found on the internet.

The data shown is real. Every mechanistic claim is cited to peer-reviewed literature. The conclusions drawn are mine, and they are explicitly labeled as *what I chose to do*, not *what you should do*.

### What is and is not being claimed

- ✅ **I am sharing**: what I did, what was objectively measured, what the peer-reviewed research says about the underlying mechanisms, and what I'm personally choosing to do next.
- ❌ **I am NOT claiming**: that any protocol in this repo will work for you, that any supplement will cure or treat endometriosis, that WHOOP-tracked improvements translate to clinical outcomes, or that I'm qualified to give individual medical advice.
- ⚠️ **If you have endometriosis and are considering a detox protocol or elimination diet**, especially if you are on hormonal therapy, GnRH analogs, or NSAIDs, discuss it with your prescribing physician first.

### ⚠️ Important: no hormonal contraception during this case work

**All case studies and protocols in this repository were developed without hormonal contraception, hormonal endometriosis suppression, or HRT.** This was a deliberate choice to understand root-cause physiology — what the body does on its own — rather than measure interventions on top of a hormonally suppressed baseline.

**This is not a recommendation against birth control.** Hormonal contraception is a valid tool many people with endo use successfully. The protocols here are generally compatible with concurrent BC use, but:

- **A few supplements** referenced in this repo (notably DIM, calcium-D-glucarate, sulforaphane extracts in concentrated form, and St. John's Wort) **can theoretically alter synthetic hormone levels via the CYP450 enzyme system.** If you are on combined oral contraceptives, progestin-only methods, hormonal IUDs, GnRH agonists, or HRT, **discuss the full supplement list with your prescriber before starting any protocol.**
- **Cycle-phase data shown in case studies reflects natural endogenous cycles.** Your physiological signatures on BC will differ. The protocol may still help, but the specific HRV, skin-temperature, and recovery patterns documented here are not what to expect if you're hormonally cycled.
- **Never stop prescribed hormonal medication without medical supervision.**

See [`research/birth-control-context.md`](research/birth-control-context.md) for the detailed scientific framing of why this choice was made and how it affects data interpretation.

## 💰 Affiliate relationships

When a post contains an affiliate link, there is a clear disclosure at the top of that post AND next to the link itself. Currently active affiliate relationships:

| Partner | Product | Commission structure | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Fullscript / Designs for Health** | Core Restore 14-day protocol + individual supplements | ~20–25% via practitioner dispensary | 🔄 Pending — applying through Parsley Health practitioner |
| **WHOOP** | WHOOP membership + hardware | Referral program (one free month per signup) | 🔄 Pending |
| **Parsley Health** | Functional medicine membership | Referral or discount link | 🔄 Asking |
| **Amazon Associates** | Books + hardware | 1–4% commission | 🔄 Pending |
| **SweatHouse** | Infrared sauna membership | Local business — asking about referral program | 🔄 Asking |
| **Evvy** | At-home vaginal microbiome test (mNGS + PCR) | Referral code / affiliate program — asking | 🔄 Asking |

**I do not accept sponsorship for case-study content.** The protocol choices are driven by what I'm personally trying, not what a brand paid me to try. If that ever changes, you will know because there will be a "Sponsored" tag at the top of the post.

## 🧪 Data sourcing

All WHOOP data comes from my own account via the [whoop-ai-mcp](https://github.com/shashankswe2020-ux/whoop-mcp) server. Before any CSV or chart is committed to this repo, the `scripts/export-csv.mjs` pipeline strips:

- `user_id`
- Email address
- Precise timestamps (rounded to date where possible)
- Device serial numbers
- Any free-text fields

If you ever spot PII in the committed data, open an issue — I will treat it as a P0.

## 🧭 Editorial principles

1. **The data tells the story, and when the data is ambiguous I say so.** If HRV moved, I report the number. If I can't rule out a confounder, I name it.
2. **Honesty about what n=1 does and doesn't prove.** A single person's physiological response to a protocol is not population-level evidence. It's a hypothesis generator, not a conclusion.
3. **No before/after photos, no weight loss claims, no "transformation" framing.** That's the genre I'm explicitly not writing.
4. **Respect for mainstream medicine + respect for lived experience.** Both can be partially right. The goal is to find the intersection where evidence-based practice and personal physiological signal agree.
