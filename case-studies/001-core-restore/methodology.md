# Methodology — Case Study 001

## Data source

All data was pulled from my personal WHOOP 4.0 account on **2026-04-23** using the [whoop-ai-mcp](https://github.com/shashankswe2020-ux/whoop-mcp) open-source MCP server + the `scripts/pull-whoop.mjs` wrapper in this repository. The 45-day window captures 27 days of pre-detox baseline, the 14 days of Core Restore (with infrared sauna sessions throughout), and the immediate post-detox clean window.

### Tools used

- **WHOOP 4.0 strap** (worn 24/7)
- **WHOOP API v2** via OAuth2 + PKCE
- **[whoop-ai-mcp](https://github.com/shashankswe2020-ux/whoop-mcp)** as the auth + API client wrapper
- **Node 20+** to run the analysis scripts

### Endpoints used

- `/v2/recovery` — daily recovery score, HRV (rmssd), resting heart rate, SpO2, skin temperature
- `/v2/activity/sleep` — sleep stage breakdown, duration, performance, respiratory rate
- `/v2/activity/workout` — individual workouts with strain and HR zones
- `/v2/cycle` — daily physiological cycle with aggregate strain

## Phase definitions

See [`phases.json`](phases.json). Phases are date ranges I assigned based on my own calendar:

| Phase | Range | Days | Definition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pre-detox baseline | 2026-03-09 → 2026-04-04 | 27 | Normal eating, normal training, normal life |
| Core Restore | 2026-04-05 → 2026-04-18 | 14 | On-protocol: elimination diet + supplements + 2 shakes/day + infrared sauna sessions throughout |
| Post-detox clean | 2026-04-19 | 1 | Immediate rest day following the 14-day cycle |

## Statistical approach

**I did not run significance tests.** The sample size is too small, phases are unequal length, and the variables are highly autocorrelated day-to-day. Running a t-test would be dressing up a case study as a trial. Instead, I report:

- **Medians** per phase (less sensitive to single bad nights than means)
- **Percent change** for HRV specifically (log-distributed, percent is more interpretable than absolute ms)
- **Direction and magnitude**, framed as observations, not conclusions

Confounders are listed explicitly in the main case study post.

## What I didn't do (on purpose)

- **Withhold data.** All 45 days of daily summaries are in [`data/daily-summary.csv`](data/daily-summary.csv). If you want to run your own analysis, the CSV is the source.
- **Cherry-pick windows.** The phase boundaries are my calendar dates, not the dates that make the effect look biggest.
- **Subtract training load.** I considered normalizing HRV against cycle strain, but the strain variation during the window is within a small enough range that the correction wouldn't change the direction of the effect. If you're a more elite athlete reading this and want the strain-adjusted analysis, the raw data is public — please DIY and publish your version.

## Data pipeline reproducibility

```bash
# 1. Pull raw data (outputs ~/Documents/Dev Projects/diet-signal/whoop-raw.json by default)
node scripts/pull-whoop.mjs --days 45 --out /tmp/whoop-raw.json

# 2. Export anonymized daily summary
node scripts/export-csv.mjs \
  --in /tmp/whoop-raw.json \
  --out case-studies/001-core-restore/data/daily-summary.csv

# 3. Generate phase comparison table + daily detail
node scripts/analyze-phases.mjs \
  --data /tmp/whoop-raw.json \
  --config case-studies/001-core-restore/phases.json \
  --detail 14
```

The `/tmp/whoop-raw.json` file contains `user_id` and email — it **must not** be committed. Only the anonymized CSV ships in this repo.

## What would make future case studies better

- **Longer baseline windows** (60+ days) to reduce sensitivity to any single outlier
- **Training-load matching** between phases — if strain spikes during a test phase, isolate that
- **Menstrual cycle phase logging** so HRV is compared across similar cycle stages
- **Concurrent symptom diary** (already addressed via `templates/reintro-tracker.md`)
- **Bloodwork bookends** — Parsley runs labs periodically; pairing liver enzymes and inflammatory markers (hs-CRP, ferritin, homocysteine) with WHOOP data before/after would add a mechanistic layer
