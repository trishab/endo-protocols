> **Objective physiological data + cited research on how diet, detox, and recovery protocols interact with endometriosis — reported honestly, with every number backed by raw data.**

Part of the [**EndEndo.io**](https://endendo.io) ecosystem — the health-tech project building tools for people living with endometriosis. Where EndEndo.io is the product, `diet-signal` is the research and evidence companion: n=1 case studies that pair a dietary protocol with peer-reviewed mechanistic context and continuous WHOOP physiological data.

## Who this is for

- **People with endometriosis or adenomyosis** who already suspect food, hormones, and inflammation are interconnected and want cited research plus real data — not wellness-industry noise
- **Clinicians and functional medicine practitioners** looking for structured n=1 case reports they can share with patients who want to see what a protocol "looks like" in continuous physiology
- **Quantified-self readers** curious about whether a wearable can detect inflammatory responses to food and environmental factors
- **Researchers** interested in crowd-sourced, methodologically transparent pilot data to generate hypotheses for formal trials

## Why endometriosis specifically

Endometriosis is an **estrogen-driven inflammatory condition** affecting roughly 10% of women and people of reproductive age globally.[^1] Two aspects of the disease are directly relevant to this project:

1. **The liver metabolizes all circulating estrogens.** Endometriosis severity correlates with the balance of "safe" (2-hydroxy) vs. reactive (4-hydroxy) estrogen metabolites — a balance regulated by liver Phase 1 and Phase 2 enzymes.[^2][^3]
2. **Systemic inflammation and autonomic nervous system dysregulation are measurable** in people with endometriosis using heart rate variability (HRV) and other wearable-derived markers.[^4] That means protocols targeting inflammation and estrogen clearance can, in principle, be *objectively tracked* — not just self-reported.

This is the opportunity this repository explores: using a consumer wearable (WHOOP) to capture the autonomic and sleep signals that shift when someone intervenes on the liver-estrogen-inflammation axis through diet, supplementation, and complementary therapies like sauna.

## What's here

- **`case-studies/`** — n=1 personal case reports with full WHOOP data, cited research context, and honest caveats
- **`studies/`** — multi-subject citizen-science studies with formal hypotheses, recruitment, and de-identified pooled data
- **`scripts/`** — Node scripts to pull WHOOP data, compute phase comparisons, and export anonymized CSVs
- **`templates/`** — reusable trackers (food reintroduction, trial protocol) that anyone can copy
- **`disclosures.md`** — affiliate relationships, data sourcing, and medical disclaimers

## Current case studies (n=1)

| # | Protocol | Status | Key WHOOP signal |
|---|----------|--------|------------------|
| [001](case-studies/001-core-restore/) | **Core Restore 14-day liver cleanse (with infrared sauna throughout)** | 📝 Draft | HRV ⬆⬆ · Recovery ⬆⬆ · Resting HR ⬇ · Sleep ⬆ |

## Current studies (n>1, citizen science)

| # | Study | Status | Participants needed |
|---|-------|--------|---------------------|
| [001](studies/001-evvy-surgery-recovery/) | **Vaginal microbiome and endometriosis surgical recovery** (Evvy + WHOOP) | 📋 Protocol — recruiting | 10–30 participants with endo + planned laparoscopic surgery |

## The core principle

*Your wearable moves before you consciously do.* HRV, resting HR, and sleep performance often register inflammatory responses 24–48 hours before they surface as symptoms. For endometriosis — where inflammation is continuous and symptom attribution to any one trigger is notoriously difficult — this is a real diagnostic window.

Every claim in every case study is tied to (a) the raw anonymized data in `data/daily-summary.csv` and (b) peer-reviewed research in `research.md`. If a statement isn't backed by one of the two, it's labeled as personal experience.

## Using these scripts

```bash
# Install (Node 20+)
npm install

# --- WHOOP ---
# Pull your last 45 days of WHOOP data (requires whoop-ai-mcp token at ~/.whoop-mcp/tokens.json)
node scripts/pull-whoop.mjs --days 45 --out /tmp/whoop-raw.json

# Export an anonymized daily summary (no user_id, no email)
node scripts/export-csv.mjs --in /tmp/whoop-raw.json --out case-studies/001-core-restore/data/daily-summary.csv

# Run a phase comparison against a config
node scripts/analyze-phases.mjs --data /tmp/whoop-raw.json --config case-studies/001-core-restore/phases.json

# --- Garmin (longitudinal — extends history beyond WHOOP ownership window) ---
# 1. In Garmin Connect web → Account → Manage Your Data → "Export Your Data"
#    Garmin emails a download link within ~24h. Unzip the result.
# 2. (First run only) Inspect the export structure to confirm parser will work:
node scripts/parse-garmin-export.mjs --export-dir ~/Downloads/garmin-export --out /tmp/garmin-daily.csv --inspect
# 3. Parse to a daily CSV:
node scripts/parse-garmin-export.mjs --export-dir ~/Downloads/garmin-export --out /tmp/garmin-daily.csv

# --- Merge WHOOP + Garmin into one longitudinal CSV ---
node scripts/merge-longitudinal.mjs \
  --whoop case-studies/001-core-restore/data/daily-summary.csv \
  --garmin /tmp/garmin-daily.csv \
  --out case-studies/001-core-restore/data/longitudinal-summary.csv
```

### Why merge WHOOP and Garmin?

WHOOP gives you the strongest single-platform signal (continuous HRV at high temporal resolution), but most readers haven't owned a WHOOP since the dawn of time. Garmin coverage often goes back further — 2–5+ years for many users. Merging the two lets a case study span **multiple intervention episodes** (e.g., a 2025 detox AND a 2026 detox) instead of being limited to whatever year the wearable changed.

The two sources report slightly different metrics: WHOOP gives recovery score and rmssd-style HRV; Garmin gives resting HR, body battery, stress score, and (newer devices) a different HRV calculation. The merged CSV preserves both with `whoop_` and `garmin_` prefixes so downstream analysis can cross-validate or pick the cleaner signal per metric.
